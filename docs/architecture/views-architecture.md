# AutoDev-AI Views Architecture Design

## System Overview

This document outlines the architecture for the AutoDev-AI Neural Bridge Platform's view layer implementation (roadmap items 287-297). The design follows SOLID principles, leverages existing UI components, and implements a modular view system with proper error boundaries and state management.

## Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: View Layer Structure
**Decision**: Implement views in `src/views/` directory with dedicated components for each major feature area.

**Rationale**: 
- Separation of concerns between UI components and application views
- Improved maintainability and testability
- Clear component hierarchy: Views compose UI components

**Trade-offs**: Additional abstraction layer, but provides better organization

### ADR-002: State Management Pattern
**Decision**: Use React hooks with prop drilling for view state, maintain global state in App component.

**Rationale**:
- Existing App component already manages global state effectively
- Avoid introducing additional state management complexity
- Views are presentation-focused with minimal local state

### ADR-003: Error Boundary Implementation
**Decision**: Implement hierarchical error boundaries at view and component levels.

**Rationale**:
- Graceful error handling without full application crashes
- Improved user experience with fallback UI
- Better error reporting and debugging capabilities

**Components**: TaskList, ResultCard, FilterControls
**State**: Historical executions, filters, pagination

### 4. Sandbox View (290)
**Purpose**: Docker environment management
**Components**: DockerSandbox, ContainerList, EnvironmentControls
**State**: Container status, environment configuration

### 5. Monitoring View (291)
**Purpose**: Detailed system monitoring and logs
**Components**: LogViewer, SystemMetrics, AlertPanel
**State**: Log streams, system metrics, active alerts

### 6. Terminal View (292)
**Purpose**: Direct terminal interface

**State**: Terminal sessions, command history, output streams

## Data Flow Architecture

```
App (Global State)
├── Configuration State
├── Execution State
├── Output Streams
└── Navigation State
     │
     ├── Views (Local State)
     │   ├── View-specific state
     │   └── UI interactions
     │
     └── UI Components (Stateless)
         ├── Pure presentation
         └── Event handlers
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Boundary Hierarchy
1. **App Level**: Catches critical application errors
2. **View Level**: Handles view-specific errors with fallback UI
3. **Component Level**: Manages component-specific errors

### Error Recovery
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features
- Error reporting to console/logging service
- User-friendly error messages with recovery actions

## Performance Considerations

### Code Splitting
- Lazy load views for improved initial load time
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Route-based code splitting

### State Optimization
- Minimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Memoization for expensive computations
- Efficient state updates

### Bundle Size
- Tree-shaking for unused code
- Optimized imports from UI component library
- Webpack bundle analysis

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Component isolation with React Testing Library
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error boundaries and recovery

### Integration Testing
- View-level interaction testing
- State management validation
- Error scenario testing

### E2E Testing
- User workflow validation
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance regression testing

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate configuration parameters
- Secure command execution

### State Security
- Prevent sensitive data exposure
- Secure localStorage usage
- CSRF protection for forms

## Deployment Architecture

### Build Process
- TypeScript compilation
- Asset optimization
- Bundle generation with Vite

### Development Server
- Hot module replacement
- Development-specific configurations
- Debug tooling integration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Views (287-292)
