- **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation and validation testing

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Build Caching**: Improved Rust dependency caching with Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
- **Parallel Compilation**: Optimized build process for faster CI execution
- **Resource Management**: Better memory and CPU usage in build environment
- **Timeout Management**: Realistic timeouts for complex build processes

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
All CI/CD builds were failing at the "Build Tauri" step because:
1. **Missing System Dependencies**: GTK and WebKit libraries not installed in CI environment
2. **Incorrect Build Process**: Using `cargo build` instead of proper Tauri CLI build
3. **Pre-build Script Failures**: Tauri's before-build.sh required cargo fmt, clippy, and check to pass
4. **Missing Rust Modules**: Compilation failed due to unimplemented module references
5. **TypeScript Errors**: Frontend compilation blocked by type definition issues

### The Solution  
Comprehensive fix addressing all failure points:
- ✅ **System Dependencies**: Added apt-get install for required Linux packages
- ✅ **Build Process**: Switched to `tauri build --no-bundle` with proper CLI installation
- ✅ **Pre-build Compliance**: Applied cargo fmt, implemented clippy fixes, ensured cargo check passes
- ✅ **Module Implementation**: Created all missing Rust modules with complete functionality
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript errors in configuration components
