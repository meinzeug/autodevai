# Terraform Security Fixes Documentation

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive security fixes applied to the AutoDevAI Terraform
infrastructure to address critical security vulnerabilities and implement best practices.

## üîí Critical Security Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Public IP Address Exposure (RESOLVED)

**Issue**: AWS subnets were configured to automatically assign public IP addresses. **Fix**: Set
`map_public_ip_on_launch = false` in public subnets configuration. **Location**:
`/infrastructure/terraform/main.tf:64`

```hcl
resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnets" {
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false  # Security fix applied
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ EC2 Metadata Service v1 Enabled (RESOLVED)

**Issue**: EC2 instances using IMDSv1 which is vulnerable to SSRF attacks. **Fix**: Enforced IMDSv2
with `http_tokens = "required"` in launch template. **Location**:
`/infrastructure/terraform/eks.tf:154-159`

```hcl
metadata_options {
  http_endpoint = "enabled"
  http_tokens   = "required"  # IMDSv2 enforcement
  http_put_response_hop_limit = 1
  instance_metadata_tags = "enabled"
}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ ECR Mutable Image Tags (RESOLVED)

**Issue**: ECR repositories allowing mutable image tags creates security risks. **Fix**: Set
`image_tag_mutability = "IMMUTABLE"` for all ECR repositories. **Location**:
`/infrastructure/terraform/additional-services.tf:141,184`

```hcl
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "autodevai_gui" {
  image_tag_mutability = "IMMUTABLE"  # Security fix applied
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Enhancements Implemented

### 4. Security Group Hardening

**Enhancement**: Implemented least privilege principle for security groups. **Changes**:

- Restricted HTTP/HTTPS access to ALB only (removed 0.0.0.0/0)
- Added descriptive rules with comments
- Implemented explicit egress rules
- Added variable for allowed CIDR blocks

```hcl
# Before: Open to all
cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

# After: Restricted to specific sources
security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb_sg.id]
cidr_blocks = var.allowed_cidr_blocks
```

### 5. VPC Flow Logs

**Enhancement**: Added comprehensive network monitoring. **Implementation**:

- CloudWatch log group for VPC flow logs
- IAM role with least privilege permissions
- 30-day log retention for compliance

### 6. S3 Bucket Security

**Enhancement**: Blocked all public access to S3 buckets. **Implementation**:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "bucket_pab" {
  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```

### 7. GuardDuty Threat Detection

**Enhancement**: Enabled AWS GuardDuty with comprehensive data sources. **Features**:

- S3 logs analysis
- Kubernetes audit logs
- Malware protection for EC2 instances
- EBS volume scanning

### 8. CloudTrail API Auditing

**Enhancement**: Complete API call auditing and logging. **Implementation**:

- Multi-region trail
- S3 data events monitoring
- Secure S3 bucket with encryption
- Proper IAM policies for CloudTrail service

### 9. AWS Config Compliance Monitoring

**Enhancement**: Continuous compliance monitoring with Config rules. **Rules Implemented**:

- S3 bucket public access prohibited
- EBS volumes encryption required
- RDS storage encryption required
- SSH access restrictions

### 10. AWS Security Hub

**Enhancement**: Centralized security findings management. **Standards Enabled**:

- AWS Foundational Security Standard
- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark

### 11. WAF Protection

**Enhancement**: Web Application Firewall for application protection. **Rule Sets**:

- Common attack patterns
- Known bad inputs
- SQL injection protection
- Associated with Application Load Balancer

### 12. Security Monitoring & Alerting

**Enhancement**: CloudWatch-based security monitoring. **Features**:

- Suspicious network activity detection
- Metric filters for VPC Flow Logs
- SNS alerts for security events
- Automated threat detection

## üîß Configuration Variables

### Security-Related Variables

```hcl
variable "allowed_cidr_blocks" {
  description = "CIDR blocks allowed to access the infrastructure"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Should be restricted in production
}
```

**Recommendation**: Replace default CIDR blocks with specific IP ranges for production:

```hcl
allowed_cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.0.0/16", "YOUR_OFFICE_IP/32"]
```
