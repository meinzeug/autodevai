# GitHub Actions Security Fixes Report

## Overview

This report documents the comprehensive security fixes applied to all GitHub Actions workflows to resolve 28+ security vulnerabilities and implement security best practices.

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity)
**Issue**: Workflows used unsafe interpolation of GitHub context variables directly in shell commands.

**Fixed in workflows**:
- `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- `.github/workflows/pr.yml`
- `.github/workflows/issue-on-failure.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build-automation.yml`
- `.github/actions/create-failure-issue/action.yml`

**Fixes Applied**:
- Replaced direct variable interpolation with environment variables
- Added input sanitization and validation
- Used `printf` instead of `echo` for safe output
- Added regex validation for all user inputs
- Implemented proper escaping of shell metacharacters

### 2. Action Version Pinning (Medium Severity)
**Issue**: All GitHub Actions used mutable tags (e.g., `@v4`) instead of pinned commit SHAs.

**Actions Pinned to Secure SHAs**:
- `actions/checkout@692973e3d937129bcbf40652eb9f2f61becf3332` # v4.1.7
- `actions/setup-node@60edb5dd545a775178f52524783378180af0d1f8` # v4.0.2
- `actions/upload-artifact@65462800fd760344b1a7b4382951275a0abb4808` # v4.3.3
- `actions/download-artifact@65a9edc5881444af0b9093a5e628f2fe47ea3b2e` # v4.1.7

- `docker/build-push-action@2cdde995de11925a030ce8070c3d77a52ffcf1c0` # v5.3.0

- `geekyeggo/delete-artifact@24928e75e6e6590170563b8ddae9fac674508aa1` # v5.0.0

### 3. Missing Security Permissions (Medium Severity)
**Issue**: Workflows used default overly permissive GITHUB_TOKEN permissions.

**Permissions Added**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # Read repository contents
  issues: write          # Create and update issues
  actions: read          # Read workflow run information
  security-events: write # Write security events
  pull-requests: write   # Comment on PRs (where needed)
  packages: write        # Push Docker images (release only)
  discussions: write     # Create discussions (release only)
```

### 4. Environment Variable Injection (High Severity)
**Issue**: Direct use of environment variables in shell commands without proper escaping.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Used bash parameter expansion instead of direct variable substitution
- Added proper quoting and escaping
- Implemented input length limits and character filtering
- Used heredoc syntax for multi-line content

## Specific Security Improvements by Workflow

### Main Workflow (`main.yml`)
1. Added minimal permissions scope
2. Pinned all actions to commit SHAs
