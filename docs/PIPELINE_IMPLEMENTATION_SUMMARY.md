## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow Design
```yaml
# Key architectural decisions:
- Concurrency control to prevent multiple runs
- Maintenance branch strategy for safe rollbacks  
- Comprehensive timeout settings (5-30 minutes per job)
- Encrypted secrets management
- Multi-stage dependency chain with failure handling
```

### Security Architecture
```bash
# Multi-layered approach:
1. NPM Audit (Node.js dependencies)
2. Cargo Audit (Rust dependencies) 
3. Trivy Scanner (filesystem vulnerabilities)
4. License Compliance (legal risk assessment)
5. Automated fixing with safety verification
```

### Rollback Strategy
```bash
# Graduated response system:
- Health Score 80-100: Normal operation
- Health Score 50-79: Warning alerts
- Health Score 25-49: Degraded mode
- Health Score 0-24: Emergency rollback
```
