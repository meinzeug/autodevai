# GitHub Security & Status Dashboard

_Last Updated: 2025-09-11 09:55:00 UTC_

## 🔐 Authentication Status

- ✅ **GitHub CLI Authenticated**: Active as `meinzeug`
- ✅ **Token Scope**: Full access with 17+ scopes (admin, repo, workflow, etc.)
- ✅ **Git Protocol**: HTTPS configured

## 🛡️ Security Analysis

### Code Scanning Alerts: 1 ACTIVE

- **MEDIUM Severity**: `glib` Rust dependency vulnerability (GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g)
  - **Package**: glib 0.18.5 → needs upgrade to 0.20.0
  - **Location**: `src-tauri/Cargo.lock:2017-2038`
  - **Issue**: Unsoundness in Iterator implementations causing NULL pointer dereferences
  - **Impact**: Potential crashes in Tauri application
  - **Action Required**: Update Rust dependencies in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

### Branch Protection: ❌ NOT CONFIGURED

- Main branch lacks protection rules
- No required reviews, status checks, or merge restrictions
- **Security Risk**: High - allows direct pushes to main

## 📈 Repository Metrics

- **Language**: Rust (Tauri application)
- **Size**: 17,133 KB
- **Open Issues**: 12 total
- **Open PRs**: 4 (all from Dependabot)
- **Watchers**: 0
- **Forks**: 0

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES

### 1. Build System Failure (PRIORITY: CRITICAL)

**Status**: 8 consecutive CI/CD failures affecting all PRs

**Failed Workflows**:

- All builds failing at "Build Tauri" step (step 10)
- Both main branch and PR builds affected
- Security scans passing, but build system completely broken

**Impact**:

- ❌ **BLOCKS ALL PR MERGES** (4 Dependabot PRs stalled)
- ❌ **BLOCKS FEATURE DEVELOPMENT**
- ❌ **BLOCKS SECURITY UPDATES**

**Recent Failures**:

1. **#107** (2025-09-11 09:38) - PR #72 merge attempt - BUILD FAILED
2. **#106** (2025-09-11 09:37) - Main branch push - BUILD FAILED
3. **#105** (2025-09-11 09:34) - Main branch push - BUILD FAILED
4. **#104** (2025-09-11 09:32) - PR #76 merge attempt - BUILD FAILED
5. **#103** (2025-09-11 09:31) - PR #75 merge attempt - BUILD FAILED

### 2. Dependency Management Backlog

**Status**: 4 Dependabot PRs blocked by build failures

**Pending Updates**:

- **PR #76**: Major dev dependencies (2 updates) - MERGEABLE but build failing
- **PR #75**: Major dev dependencies (4 updates) - Unknown merge status
- **PR #73**: Production dependencies (2 updates) - Unknown merge status
- **PR #72**: GitHub Actions (actions/checkout 4→5) - MERGEABLE

**Security Impact**: Unable to apply security patches due to CI/CD blockage

### 3. Issue Backlog Growth

**Status**: 8 automated CI failure issues created today (2025-09-11)

**Auto-Generated Issues** (all priority:high):

- Issues #83, #82, #81, #80, #79, #78, #77, #74
- All contain identical "Build Tauri" failure pattern
- Assigned to @meinzeug (issues #82, #81, #74)

## 🔧 Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: CI/CD Recovery (CRITICAL)

1. **Investigate Tauri Build Failure**
   - Check `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` for dependency conflicts
   - Verify Rust toolchain version compatibility
   - Review build artifacts from failure logs
2. **Fix Build Configuration**
   - Update Rust dependencies causing build failures
   - Resolve any version conflicts or missing dependencies
   - Test build locally before pushing

3. **Clear Dependabot PR Backlog**
   - Merge PR #72 (actions/checkout update) - currently MERGEABLE
   - Address other PRs once CI is stable

### Phase 2: Security Hardening (HIGH)

1. **Branch Protection Implementation**
   - Require PR reviews before merge
   - Require status checks (CI/CD) to pass
   - Restrict direct pushes to main branch

2. **Dependency Vulnerability Resolution**
   - Update glib from 0.18.5 to 0.20.0 in Cargo.toml
   - Run security scan after update to verify fix

### Phase 3: Process Improvements (MEDIUM)

1. **Issue Management**
   - Close duplicate CI failure issues once root cause resolved
   - Implement better failure notification strategy
2. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure alerts for critical CI failures
   - Set up dependency vulnerability monitoring

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- ✅ CI/CD pipeline: 0% success rate → Target: >95%
- ✅ Security alerts: 1 active → Target: 0 active
- ✅ PR merge time: Blocked → Target: <24h for Dependabot
- ✅ Branch protection: None → Target: Full protection enabled

## 📊 Workflow Status Summary
