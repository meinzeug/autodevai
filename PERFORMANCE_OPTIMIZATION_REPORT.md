4. Initialize performance monitoring

### Phase 2: Backend Optimizations (1-2 weeks)
1. Integrate optimized Rust orchestration service
2. Implement request batching and circuit breakers
3. Deploy performance metrics collection
4. Add connection pool monitoring

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Fine-tuning (Ongoing)
1. Continuous performance monitoring
2. Automated optimization recommendations
3. Performance regression testing
4. Capacity planning and scaling

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Frontend component optimizations (backward compatible)

## Rollback Strategy

1. **Frontend**: Feature flags for optimized components
2. **API**: Configurable caching with disable option
3. **Backend**: Gradual rollout with metrics monitoring
4. **Monitoring**: Non-invasive, can be disabled easily

## Success Metrics
