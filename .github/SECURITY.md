## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** open a public issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report via GitHub Security Advisory

1. Go to the Security tab in this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### 3. Contact Information

For urgent security matters, you can also contact:
- Email: [security@your-domain.com] (if available)
- GitHub: @meinzeug

## Security Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability within 72 hours
3. **Fix Development**: We'll work on a fix based on severity:
   - Critical: Within 7 days
   - High: Within 14 days
   - Medium: Within 30 days
   - Low: Next regular release
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure with the reporter

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Follow secure coding practices
- Run security scans before submitting PRs

### For Users

- Keep your installation up to date
- Use strong authentication methods
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Report suspected security issues promptly

## Dependency Security

### Automated Security Scanning

We use several tools to maintain dependency security:

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates with security patch prioritization
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automatic vulnerability detection
- **npm audit**: Regular security audits of npm dependencies
- **cargo audit**: Security audits for Rust dependencies

### Security Update Policy

1. **Critical vulnerabilities**: Immediate patch release
2. **High vulnerabilities**: Patch within 7 days
3. **Medium vulnerabilities**: Included in next minor release
4. **Low vulnerabilities**: Included in next major release

### Dependency Management

- We group dependencies by risk level and update frequency
- Patch updates are auto-merged after CI passes
- Minor updates are grouped and reviewed weekly
- Major updates require manual review and testing

## Security Checklist for Dependencies

### Before Adding New Dependencies

- [ ] Check dependency reputation and maintenance status
- [ ] Review security advisory history
- [ ] Verify package authenticity
- [ ] Assess if dependency is necessary
- [ ] Consider alternatives with better security records

### Regular Security Maintenance

- [ ] Weekly review of Dependabot PRs
- [ ] Monthly security audit with `npm audit` and `cargo audit`
- [ ] Quarterly review of all dependencies
- [ ] Annual security policy review

## Tauri-Specific Security

### Backend Security (Rust)

- All Tauri commands are validated and sanitized
- File system access is restricted to allowed directories
- Network requests are controlled and monitored
- Process execution is limited and sandboxed

### Frontend Security (TypeScript/React)

- Content Security Policy (CSP) is enforced
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- No direct DOM manipulation without sanitization
- Secure communication with Tauri backend

### Build Security

- Dependencies are locked with exact versions
- Build process runs in isolated environment
- Code signing for release builds
- Integrity checks for all artifacts

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Breach

1. **Immediate Response** (0-1 hour):
   - Assess scope and impact
   - Contain the issue if possible
   - Document timeline and actions

2. **Short-term Response** (1-24 hours):
   - Notify affected users if applicable
   - Implement temporary mitigations
   - Begin developing permanent fix

3. **Long-term Response** (1-7 days):
   - Deploy permanent fix
   - Conduct post-incident review
   - Update security measures
   - Publish security advisory
