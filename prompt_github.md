# GitHub Workflow Automation - Optimized Execution Order

## üéØ WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

This prompt defines the **STRICT execution order** for GitHub synchronization and development workflow.
The system follows a **3-phase sequential process** that ensures GitHub is fully synchronized and secure
before any roadmap execution begins.

## ‚ö° EXECUTION PHASES (STRICT ORDER - NO SKIPPING)

### PHASE 1: GitHub Synchronization & PR Management
**Objective**: Ensure main branch is up-to-date with all safe changes merged

1. **Check for Dependabot PRs** (PRIORITY: HIGHEST)
   ```bash
   gh pr list --label dependencies --state open
   ```
   - Auto-merge all patch updates
   - Auto-merge minor updates with passing tests
   - Request review for major updates

2. **Process all open PRs targeting main**
   ```bash
   gh pr list --base main --state open
   ```
   - Merge approved PRs with passing CI
   - Resolve conflicts automatically where possible
   - Escalate complex conflicts for manual review

3. **Sync local with remote main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main --rebase
   ```

**‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete when:**
- No mergeable PRs remain open
- Local main matches remote main exactly
- No merge conflicts exist

---

### PHASE 2: Security & Issue Resolution
**Objective**: Fix all security vulnerabilities and GitHub issues locally

1. **Security Vulnerability Scan & Fix**
   ```bash
   npm audit fix --force
   cargo audit fix
   ```
   - Fix all high/critical vulnerabilities
   - Document any that cannot be auto-fixed
   - Create issues for manual fixes needed

2. **GitHub Issues Resolution**
   ```bash
   gh issue list --state open --label bug,security
   ```
   - Fix all automated test failures
   - Resolve security issues
   - Fix CI/CD pipeline issues

3. **Validate Fixes**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run build
   cargo test
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. **Push fixes to main**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: Resolve GitHub issues and security vulnerabilities"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Close resolved issues**
   ```bash
   gh issue close [ISSUE_NUMBER] --comment "Resolved in latest commit"
   ```

**‚úÖ Phase 2 Complete when:**
- No security vulnerabilities remain
- All CI/CD checks pass
- All automated issues are closed
- Main branch is green (all checks passing)

---

### PHASE 3: Roadmap Execution
**Objective**: Execute development tasks from roadmap.md

**‚ö†Ô∏è PREREQUISITE CHECK (MANDATORY):**
```bash
# This check MUST pass before roadmap execution
./scripts/github-status-check.sh

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ No open Dependabot PRs
# ‚úÖ No open PRs targeting main
# ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities
# ‚úÖ No failing CI/CD checks
# ‚úÖ Main branch is up-to-date
```

**Only if ALL checks pass**, proceed with roadmap:

1. **Read roadmap.md**
   ```bash
   cat docs/roadmap.md
   ```

2. **Execute roadmap tasks in priority order**
   - High priority items first
   - Follow SPARC methodology
   - Create feature branches as needed

3. **Create PR for completed work**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --title "feat: [Roadmap item]"
   ```

**‚úÖ Phase 3 Complete when:**
- Roadmap tasks are implemented
- PR is created for review
- All tests pass

## ü§ñ AUTOMATION CONFIGURATION

### Daily Dependabot Schedule
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
schedule:
  interval: "daily"
  time: "09:00"
groups:
  all-dependencies:
    patterns: ["*"]
    update-types: ["minor", "patch"]
```

### Auto-Merge Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/auto-merge.yml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  auto-merge:
    if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'
    steps:
      - name: Auto-merge safe updates
        run: gh pr merge --auto --squash
```

### Security Auto-Fix
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-fix.yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 8 * * *'  # Daily at 8 AM

jobs:
  security:
    steps:
      - name: Fix vulnerabilities
        run: |
          npm audit fix --force
          cargo audit fix
```

## üìã EXECUTION COMMANDS

### One-Command Workflow Execution
```bash
# Complete workflow in correct order
./scripts/github-workflow.sh

# Individual phases
./scripts/execute-phase.sh 1  # GitHub Sync
./scripts/execute-phase.sh 2  # Security Fix
./scripts/execute-phase.sh 3  # Roadmap Execute
```

### Status Checks
```bash
# Check if ready for next phase
./scripts/github-status-check.sh

# Detailed status report
gh pr list --state open
gh issue list --state open
npm audit
cargo audit

## üö® FAILURE RECOVERY

### If Phase 1 Fails (PR Merge Issues)
```bash
# Manual conflict resolution
gh pr view [PR_NUMBER]
git checkout -b fix-conflicts
git merge main
# Fix conflicts manually

```bash
# Manual security fix
npm audit
# Review and fix manually
npm update [package]
# Or add to exceptions if false positive
echo "[package]" >> .auditignore

# Phase 2: Security Fix
echo "üîí PHASE 2: Security & Issue Resolution"
./scripts/security/security-fix.sh || exit 1

# Phase 3: Roadmap (only if prerequisites pass)

## üìù IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **NEVER skip phases** - The order is critical for maintaining repository integrity
2. **ALWAYS check prerequisites** before Phase 3 (roadmap execution)
3. **Daily Dependabot runs at 9:00 AM** - Plan work accordingly
4. **Security fixes are MANDATORY** - Never proceed with vulnerabilities
5. **Roadmap execution is CONDITIONAL** - Only when GitHub is clean
