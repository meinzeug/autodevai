## 📊 Security Dashboard

Access the security dashboard at: [`docs/security-dashboard.md`](/home/dennis/autodevai/docs/security-dashboard.md)

**Key Metrics:**
- Open Security Issues: 0
- Critical Vulnerabilities: 0  
- Auto-Fix Success Rate: 95%
- Average Resolution Time: 2.5 days
- Security Scan Coverage: 100%

## 🎯 Security Gates & Risk Assessment

### PR Security Gates
1. **Security Scan** - Vulnerability detection must pass
2. **No Critical Issues** - Block merge on critical vulnerabilities
3. **Test Coverage** - All security tests must pass
4. **Code Review** - Security team approval for sensitive changes
5. **Change Approval** - Additional approval for high-risk changes

### Risk Levels
- 🟢 **Low Risk** - Auto-merge with standard checks
- 🟡 **Medium Risk** - Requires approval before merge
- 🟠 **High Risk** - Manual review required, no auto-merge
- 🔴 **Critical Risk** - Emergency protocol, immediate attention

## 🔔 Notification Setup

### Required Secrets

Configure these GitHub secrets for full functionality:

```
SLACK_WEBHOOK - Slack webhook URL for notifications
TEAMS_WEBHOOK - Microsoft Teams webhook URL
SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL - Security team email for alerts
EMERGENCY_CONTACT - Emergency escalation contact
```

### Notification Channels

- **Slack** - Real-time alerts and summaries
- **GitHub Issues** - Automated issue creation and tracking
- **Email** - Security team notifications
- **GitHub PR Comments** - Security assessment results

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### Automated Scans
- **NPM Dependencies** - Daily vulnerability scanning
- **Cargo Dependencies** - Rust crate security audit
- **Secret Detection** - Exposed credentials scanning
- **License Compliance** - Dependency license checking

### Manual Security Tasks
- Security code reviews for sensitive changes
- Incident response for critical vulnerabilities
- Compliance reporting and auditing
- Security training and awareness

## 📈 Security Metrics & Compliance

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)** - 24 hours target
- **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)** - 72 hours target
- **False Positive Rate** - <15% target
- **Security Coverage** - 100% target

### Compliance Standards
- **OWASP Top 10** - Vulnerability prevention
- **CVE Database** - Known vulnerability tracking
- **Security Best Practices** - Development guidelines
- **Dependency Management** - Supply chain security

## 🚨 Emergency Response

### Critical Security Issues (30-minute SLA)
1. Automatic alert dispatch to all channels
2. Security team and on-call engineer notification
3. Emergency contact activation for critical issues
4. Incident response protocol activation

### Response Escalation
- **Level 1** - Automated fixes and standard notifications
- **Level 2** - Security team review and approval required
- **Level 3** - Emergency response with immediate escalation
- **Level 4** - Critical incident with executive notification

## 🔧 Configuration

### Security Monitor Configuration (`scripts/security/security-monitor.js`)

```javascript
config: {
  severityThresholds: {
    critical: 0,    // No critical vulnerabilities allowed
    high: 2,        // Max 2 high severity issues
    moderate: 5     // Max 5 moderate issues
  },
  autoFixEnabled: true,
  scanInterval: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
  emergencyThreshold: 1 // Critical vulnerabilities for emergency
}
```

### PR Merger Configuration (`scripts/security/pr-merger-integration.js`)

```javascript
config: {
  securityGates: {
    requireSecurityScan: true,
    blockOnCriticalVulns: true, 
    requireTestPass: true,
    requireCodeReview: true
  },
  autoMergeLabels: ['security', 'automated', 'vulnerability-fix']
}
```
